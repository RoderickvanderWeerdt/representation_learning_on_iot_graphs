# representation_learning_on_iot_graphs
 
This code was used to perform the experiments for the paper: "Representation Learning on IoT Knowledge Graphs", which is currently under review at Semantics 2024. 
This paper is an extension of the 2023 SWoCoT workshop paper: "Evaluating the Effect of Semantic Enrichment on Entity Embeddings of IoT Knowledge Graphs", which is added to this repository as an anonymized paper, so it can be used during the review.
